I need to store information about this page for archiving purpose, creating a report of it.
I need a JSON answer from you. You can use markdown in values.
Read the opened current page to do a few separate things for me:
- summary: create a summary about it
- keypoints: a list of a few key points about the page, using format `**Keypoint title**: keypoint summary`
- tags: a list of a few tag about the article (e.g. 'web', 'react', 'golang', 'architecture', the framework if any, essential keyword, do not be too specific), at most 5. The tags will help me archive and retrieve articles summary. Also a tag should be a word, of use a dash if multiple words, no caps all lower case.
The user will now provide you with the page content.
